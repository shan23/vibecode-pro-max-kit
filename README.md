## Install

### Any project (new or existing)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withkynam/vibecode-pro-max-kit/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open Claude Code and say:

```
Run vc-setup
```

**That's it.** vc-setup handles everything automatically:

- **Fresh project?** Installs the full harness, then studies your codebase
- **Existing `.claude/` config?** Merges safely — your settings, hooks, and custom configs are preserved
- **Existing `CLAUDE.md`?** Backed up as `CLAUDE.md.pre-vibecode`, harness version installed

After install, vc-setup runs 4 phases:

```
DETECT    → reads your package.json, detects stack, monorepo, test setup
SCAFFOLD  → creates process/ directory from seed templates
STUDY     → deep-scans your codebase, auto-populates context with REAL content
VALIDATE  → verifies everything is wired correctly
```

You end up with `process/context/all-context.md` fully populated with your architecture, patterns, test commands, and conventions. Every agent reads this on every task — zero manual setup.

### Already installed? Update anytime

```
Run vc-update
```

> Shows a dry-run diff of what changed, waits for your OK, then applies. Your project-specific files are never touched.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most agent harnesses give you configs. This gives you a **complete development system** that gets smarter the more you use it.

### 1. Phase-Locked Safety (RIPER-5)

Every request goes through strict phases. You can't accidentally ship half-baked code.

```
Your Request
  │
  ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  RESEARCH   — Read-only investigation                │
│  INNOVATE   — Explore 2-3 approaches, trade-offs     │
│  PLAN       — Write spec with checklist + blast radius│
│  EXECUTE    — Implement exactly per approved plan     │
│  UPDATE     — Capture learnings, improve the system   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The orchestrator enforces boundaries: RESEARCH can't modify files, EXECUTE can't start without an approved plan. Phase transitions require your explicit confirmation.

### 2. Living Project Knowledge (`process/`)

Your project builds a **persistent knowledge base** that agents read on every task:

```
process/
├── context/                    ← Project knowledge (grows over time)
│   ├── all-context.md          ← Root: architecture, stack, patterns, conventions
│   ├── tests/all-tests.md      ← Test commands, debugging, CI setup
│   ├── infra/all-infra.md      ← Deployment, Docker, env vars
│   └── {topic}/all-{topic}.md  ← Any domain that needs its own group
├── features/                   ← Feature-scoped plans + reports
│   ├── auth/active/            ← In-progress auth plans
│   ├── auth/completed/         ← Archived completed work
│   └── auth/reports/           ← Execution reports, learnings
├── general-plans/              ← Cross-cutting plans
│   ├── active/                 ← Current work
│   ├── completed/              ← Done and archived
│   └── reports/                ← Operational reports
├── development-protocols/      ← How agents work (managed by harness)
└── _seeds/                     ← Templates for bootstrapping (managed by harness)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Every agent reads `all-context.md` before working — they know your stack, patterns, and conventions
- Plans are durable artifacts with checklists, blast radius analysis, and verification evidence
- Feature folders accumulate knowledge: completed plans become reference for future work
- Context groups scale as your project grows — split when a topic exceeds ~800 lines

### 3. The Self-Improving Loop

This is the killer feature. After every non-trivial task:

```
EXECUTE completes
  │
  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UPDATE PROCESS                                             │
│                                                             │
│  • Archive completed plan to completed/                     │
│  • Capture learnings → update context docs                  │
│  • Fix patterns that caused bugs → update conventions       │
│  • New testing insight → update all-tests.md                │
│  • Architectural decision → update all-context.md           │
│                                                             │
│  Result: Next task starts with MORE knowledge               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUDIT SKILLS (periodic)                                    │
│                                                             │
│  • audit-context  → fix stale docs, missing groups          │
│  • audit-plans    → clean up abandoned plans                │
│  • audit-vc       → verify agent/skill parity               │
│  • ck-autoresearch → optimize metrics autonomously          │
│                                                             │
│  Result: System stays healthy as it grows                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Day 1**: Agents know nothing about your project. Context is empty.
**Day 7**: Context has your architecture, test patterns, and 3 completed feature plans.
**Day 30**: Agents anticipate your conventions, reference past decisions, and avoid known pitfalls.

The more you build, the better your agents get. No manual training required.

---

## Quickstart (after install)

**1. Generate your project context:**

```
Run the generate-context skill
```

The agent studies your repo — tech stack, file structure, patterns, tests — and writes `process/context/all-context.md`. This is the single file that makes every future agent interaction context-aware.

**2. Start building:**

```
Add a webhook notification system
```

The orchestrator auto-detects "feature request", discovers relevant skills (`ck-scenario`, `ck-security`, `web-testing`), and routes through RESEARCH → INNOVATE → PLAN → EXECUTE.

**3. Quick shortcuts:**

| What you want | What to say |
|---|---|
| Skip to implementation | `ENTER FAST MODE - add dark mode toggle` |
| Fix a small bug | `Fix the broken date format in utils.ts` (auto-routes to execute) |
| Debug something complex | `Debug why the API returns 500 on login` (routes to debugger agent) |
| Improve test coverage | `Run ck-autoresearch to improve test coverage` (autonomous loop) |

## Session Examples

### New Feature (full RIPER-5)

```
You: Add webhook support to the notifications API

Orchestrator: Detected feature request.
  Skills discovered: ck-scenario, ck-security, web-testing
  Routing to research-agent...

research-agent: Found existing notification patterns in src/notifications/...
  3 webhook libraries evaluated. Ready for INNOVATE.

You: go

innovate-agent: Three approaches compared:
  1. Event-driven with queue (recommended)
  2. Direct HTTP callbacks
  3. Polling-based
  Decision: #1 — resilient, retryable, scalable.

You: go

plan-agent: Created process/general-plans/active/webhook-support_PLAN_27-05-26.md
  12 checklist items, blast radius: 4 files, verification: 8 tests.
  Review and say "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" to proceed.

You: ENTER EXECUTE MODE

execute-agent: Implementing per plan...
  ✓ 12/12 items complete. 8 new tests passing.

Orchestrator: Implementation complete. Recommend UPDATE PROCESS
  to archive plan and capture webhook patterns in context.
```

### Quick Bug Fix (auto-routes)

```
You: Fix the date formatting bug in the dashboard

Orchestrator: Trivial fix (single file, no schema change).
  Routing directly to execute-agent.

execute-agent: Fixed format string in dashboard-utils.ts
  "YYYY-DD-MM" → "YYYY-MM-DD". Existing test updated.
```

### Fast Mode (compressed)

```
You: ENTER FAST MODE - add dark mode toggle

fast-mode-agent:
  RESEARCH: Found existing theme CSS variables...
  INNOVATE: CSS custom properties + localStorage approach...
  PLAN: Created dark-mode_PLAN_27-05-26.md (6 items)

  ⏸ PAUSED — Review plan. Say "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" to proceed.

You: ENTER EXECUTE MODE

fast-mode-agent: ✓ Toggle component, CSS variables, persistence. Done.
```

### Self-Improving Loop

```
You: ENTER UPDATE PROCESS MODE

update-process-agent:
  ✓ Archived webhook-support plan to completed/
  ✓ Added webhook retry pattern to all-context.md
  ✓ Updated all-tests.md with webhook test commands
  ✓ Noted: queue library requires Redis — added to infra context

  Next time an agent works on notifications, it already knows
  your webhook patterns, test setup, and Redis dependency.
```

## Updating the Harness

```
Run the vc-update skill
```

1. Clones latest kit from remote
2. Compares every managed file against your local copy
3. Shows a **dry-run diff table** — you see exactly what changes
4. **Waits for your OK** before touching anything
5. Updates managed files, syncs skills, refreshes seed templates
6. Records version in `.vc-version`

**Your files are safe.** `process/context/`, `process/features/`, `process/general-plans/` are **never touched** by updates. Only harness-managed files (agents, skills, hooks, protocols) get updated.

---

## For Maintainers

Push harness improvements from your development repo:

```
Run the vc-publish skill
```

1. Reads `.vc-publish-config` for kit repo checkout path
2. Diffs all managed files, skills, and seeds
3. Shows what changed — waits for version bump choice (patch/minor/major)
4. Copies, commits, tags, pushes
5. Verifies no project-specific content leaked

---

## Multi-Platform Support

| Platform | Level | What works |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Full | Agents + skills + hooks + settings |
| **Codex** | Full | Agents (.toml) + skills (symlink) + hooks |
| **Cursor** | Partial | Reads CLAUDE.md conventions |
| **Windsurf** | Partial | Reads CLAUDE.md conventions |
