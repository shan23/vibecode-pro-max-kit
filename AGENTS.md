# AGENTS.md

This file is the Codex compatibility layer for the existing `.claude/` system.

Keep this file aligned with `.claude/CLAUDE.md` as much as possible while adapting
Claude-native concepts to Codex-native constructs.

Codex discovers project-local skills from `.agents/skills/`. In this repo, `.agents/skills/`
is a symlink to `.claude/skills/` so Codex and Claude share the same underlying skill tree:

- `.claude/skills/` is the canonical source for shared skills and command-style workflows
- `.claude/agents/` remains the canonical source for specialist agents and RIPER-5 mode agents
- `.codex/agents/` mirrors `.claude/agents/` for Codex subagent roles
- shared reusable skills that Codex should discover must live under `.claude/skills/` as real `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter; agent wrappers should not exist

Prefer updating `.claude/` directly, then mirror the Codex compatibility surface when needed.
Because `.agents/skills/` resolves to the same folder, new skills added in either path appear
in both places automatically.

Don't explicitly type function return types - let TypeScript infer them.
Never define `type Result = ...` aliases or annotate return types on functions.
Use `as const` on return objects to narrow literals, for example `return { ok: true } as const`
and `return { ok: false, error: "msg" } as const`. Let TS infer the union.

In utility/helper functions (`utils/`, `lib/`), return error objects instead of throwing.
Use a result pattern like `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, error: string }`.
Let callers decide how to surface errors, for example throw or log.

## RIPER-5 Spec-Driven Development System

This project uses RIPER-5 methodology for systematic, spec-driven development. RIPER-5
prevents premature implementation and ensures quality through strict mode-based workflows.

### Shared Development Protocols

Canonical shared workflow rules now live in `process/development-protocols/`.

Read these files as needed:

- `process/development-protocols/all-development-protocols.md`
- `process/development-protocols/orchestration.md`
- `process/development-protocols/implementation-standards.md`
- `process/development-protocols/plan-lifecycle.md`
- `process/development-protocols/phase-programs.md`
- `process/development-protocols/context-maintenance.md`

### Orchestrator Role (Main Codex Session)

Delegation rules, subagent status codes (`DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `BLOCKED`,
`NEEDS_CONTEXT`), and context isolation protocol live in
`process/development-protocols/orchestration.md`.

You are the orchestrator, not the worker.

Your responsibilities:

1. Detect user intent (feature request, question, trivial fix)
2. Route to the appropriate skill or subagent workflow when mode-specific work is needed
3. Pass context efficiently (attach relevant files, summarize request)
4. Monitor protocol compliance (ensure mode workflows follow RIPER-5)

You do NOT:

- Perform research yourself when the request is explicitly a RESEARCH workflow if the dedicated `research-agent` should be used
- Brainstorm approaches yourself when the request is explicitly an INNOVATE workflow if the dedicated `innovate-agent` should be used
- Write plans yourself when the request is explicitly a PLAN workflow if the dedicated `plan-agent` should be used
- Implement code yourself when the request is explicitly an EXECUTE workflow if the dedicated `execute-agent` should be used
- Update rules yourself when the request is explicitly an UPDATE PROCESS workflow if the dedicated `update-process-agent` should be used

Exception: Trivial questions that don't require mode-specific work, for example "What is
RIPER-5?", can be answered directly.

### Repository Context

Authoritative context for this repository:

`process/context/all-context.md`

Contains:

- Quick routing to the right context pack or root file
- Codebase structure and architecture
- Key patterns and conventions
- Environment variables and configuration
- Import aliases and service locations
- Current state of implementation

Before substantial planning or implementation work, consult:

- `process/context/all-context.md`
- `process/development-protocols/all-development-protocols.md`

### Core Protocol

The complete RIPER-5 protocol is defined in the real agent files at `.claude/agents/` and mirrored
for Codex through `.codex/agents/`:

- `.claude/agents/research-agent.md`
- `.claude/agents/innovate-agent.md`
- `.claude/agents/plan-agent.md`
- `.claude/agents/execute-agent.md`
- `.claude/agents/fast-mode-agent.md`
- `.claude/agents/update-process-agent.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml` mirrors the same agent roster for Codex

The orchestrator operates outside the RIPER-5 phase modes. It routes, delegates, and monitors.
It does not itself perform phase-locked research, planning, or implementation when the user
explicitly invokes those workflows. Mode prefix is informational for the orchestrator.

Key Requirements:

- Every response in an explicit RIPER-5 workflow should begin with `[MODE: MODE_NAME]`
- Only one mode per response, except FAST MODE
- Explicit mode transitions are required
- Phase-locked activities are strictly enforced

### Mode Detection & Auto-Orchestration

Auto-Detection Patterns:

- Feature requests -> Step 0 skill discovery -> research-agent -> INNOVATE -> PLAN -> EXECUTE
- Questions -> research-agent for non-trivial investigation or direct answer for trivial conceptual questions
- Trivial fixes -> execute-agent directly with no plan required
- Bug/debug -> debugger as the default actor; helper skills like `scout`, `sequential-thinking`, and `problem-solving` may assist
- UI/frontend -> surface frontend-design skill plus research-agent
- Refactor/simplify -> code-simplifier for pure style or RESEARCH -> PLAN -> EXECUTE for behavioral refactors
- Missing context -> suggest the `generate-context` skill
- Existing plan file -> scan `process/general-plans/active/` and `process/features/*/active/`, confirm with user, resume from last phase

Large program rule:

- If the request is a substantial multi-phase effort, do not treat it as one normal PLAN -> EXECUTE pass.
- Use `process/development-protocols/phase-programs.md`.
- First recommend the plan shape, sequencing, and next actions.
- Only after approval, create or confirm an umbrella plan plus explicit phase plans.
- Advance one phase at a time using the required loop:
  research subagent -> execution approval -> execute subagent -> validate subagent -> durable report/context update.
- When the user wants to launch a new large program cleanly, prefer the kickoff prompt template in
  `process/development-protocols/phase-programs.md` rather than freehanding the structure.

When the user explicitly invokes one of the mode names or command names from the previous
`.claude` workflow, prefer the corresponding real agent definition in `.claude/agents/` /
`.codex/agents/` or the surviving real skill in `.agents/skills/`.

### Engineering Standards

Global best practices and coding conventions apply:

- TypeScript fundamentals
- Naming and data practices
- Functions, classes, and abstraction
- Testing and quality standards

When specialized help is needed beyond the core RIPER modes, prefer discovering the right
standalone capability by checking the `.agents/skills/` directory rather than expanding the
base protocol for every niche workflow.

### Technology Stack

See `process/context/all-context.md` for your project's specific technology stack,
directory structure, and architecture details. This harness is stack-agnostic.

## Shared Process Folder

Codex and Claude share the `process/` directory:

### `process/general-plans/`

Default new feature plans use date-stamped naming: `[feature]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md`

- Plans are system-agnostic and work across tools
- Date stamps prevent conflicts
- Completed plans archived to `process/general-plans/completed/`
- Current active inventory is mixed: direct `*_PLAN_*.md` files are the default, but legacy `PLAN.md`, `plan.md`, and `phase-*.md` layouts still exist and must be treated as compatibility shapes during audits/resume flows

### `process/context/`

Source of truth for project-specific knowledge. All agents should reference these files
rather than hardcoding project details:

- `all-context.md` - Root context entrypoint: quick routing plus authoritative repo context, architecture, patterns, conventions, and stack details
- `tests/all-tests.md` - Testing quick-start, runner selection, commands, debugging procedures, and routing to deeper testing docs
- `planning/example-simple-prd.md` - Reference for simple plan structure
- `planning/example-complex-prd.md` - Reference for complex plan depth

Context discovery rule: read `process/context/all-context.md` first, then load only the
relevant root file or context group. Context groups are durable knowledge domains, not
feature folders. Every group must have an `all-{group}.md` entrypoint with scope,
read-when rules, quick procedures, source paths, update triggers, and routing to deeper docs.

Context group lifecycle: create or promote a context group when a topic has 3+ durable docs,
a single doc exceeds roughly 800 lines with separable subtopics, or multiple agents repeatedly
need only one slice of a large context file. Move/split one group at a time, use `all-*.md`
entrypoints, update this router and agent prompts in the same patch, and run the
`audit-context` skill after every context organization change.

### `process/features/`

Feature-scoped storage for large feature clusters. Each feature folder contains:

- `active/` - In-progress plans
- `completed/` - Archived completed plans
- `backlog/` - Deferred/future plans
- `reports/` - Feature-specific operational reports
- `references/` - Feature-specific research and reference documents

Routing rule: When a feature has 5+ artifacts, store new plans/reports in
`process/features/{feature}/`. General or cross-cutting items go in
`process/general-plans/` with `reports/` and `references/` inside.

When routing to a subagent for a feature-scoped task, include `Feature: {feature-name}` in
the prompt and override paths:

- `Reports: {work_context}/process/features/{feature}/reports/`
- `Plans: {work_context}/process/features/{feature}/active/`

#### Feature Folder Lifecycle

At plan creation time, use this decision logic:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `process/features/{topic}/` already exists | Use it; pass `Feature: {topic}` to subagent |
| Topic clearly belongs to an existing feature | Use that feature's folder |
| New multi-phase project with 3+ planned phases | Create feature folder upfront |
| User says "this is a big feature" or names a product area | Create feature folder upfront |
| Single plan, no backlog, unclear scope | Use `process/general-plans/active/` |
| Cross-cutting work touching multiple features | Use general folders |

Promotion protocol from general to feature folder:

1. Create `process/features/{new-feature}/` with subdirs: `active/`, `completed/`, `backlog/`, `reports/`, `references/`
2. Move related artifacts from `process/general-plans/`, including reports and references, into the new feature's subdirs
3. Update the current features list in `process/context/all-context.md`
4. Inform subagents of the new feature scope going forward

Feature list maintenance: The current features list must be updated whenever a new
feature folder is created or an empty one is removed. The `update-process-agent` checks for
drift between `ls process/features/` and this list during Phase 2.

### `process/general-plans/reports/`

General/cross-cutting operational reports. Feature-specific reports live in
`process/features/{feature}/reports/`.

### `process/general-plans/references/`

General/cross-cutting research outputs. Feature-specific references live in
`process/features/{feature}/references/`.

When routing to subagents, always pass relevant `process/context/` files. As new context
files are added, for example UI patterns or deployment procedures, agents automatically benefit.

## Available Workflow Skills

Canonical workflow logic lives in `.agents/skills/` / `.claude/skills/`.
Claude command files are compatibility aliases when they still exist.

### Workflow Ownership

The active system is intentionally split into four layers:

- **Actor agents** own the actual phase or specialist role:
  - `research-agent`
  - `innovate-agent`
  - `plan-agent`
  - `execute-agent`
  - `update-process-agent`
  - `debugger`
  - `tester`
  - `code-reviewer`
  - `code-simplifier`
  - `ui-ux-designer`
  - `git-manager`
- **Contract skills** define repo workflow artifacts and durable process contracts:
  - `generate-plan`
  - `generate-context`
  - `audit-context`
  - `audit-plans`
  - `audit-vc`
  - `vc-update`
  - `vc-publish`
- **Helper skills** improve how agents work but do not own the workflow:
  - `scout`
  - `sequential-thinking`
  - `problem-solving`
  - `preview`
  - `tech-graph`
  - `watzup`
  - `xia`
  - `repomix`
  - `docs-seeker`
  - `chrome-devtools`
  - `agent-browser`
  - `context-engineering`
  - `web-testing`
  - `frontend-design`
  - `ck-predict`
  - `ck-scenario`
  - `ck-security`
  - `ck-autoresearch`
- **Orchestration utility**:
  - `team` coordinates multiple surviving actors/helpers in parallel but is not a competing default workflow owner

Former CK workflow-owner skills such as `ck:plan`, `ck:research`, `ck:cook`, `ck:fix`, and `ck:code-review` are migration sources only. Their useful practices should be absorbed into the surviving actor/contract surfaces instead of being routed as separate default workflows.

`ck:debug` remains a valid helper skill. It is not a default workflow owner, but its root-cause methodology is still available as a specialist helper alongside the `debugger` agent.

### Core Skills

- `generate-plan` - Create implementation plans (SIMPLE or COMPLEX) with explicit touchpoints, blast radius, verification evidence, and resume handoff
- `generate-context` - Generate/update repository context
- `audit-context` - Audit context routing, grouping, discoverability, and Claude/Codex wiring
- `audit-plans` - Audit active-plan inventory, staleness, and routing truth
- `audit-vc` - Audit agent harness health: agent parity, skill registry, and protocol wiring

Legacy `@sync-to-riper5.md` and `@sync-from-riper5.md` commands are intentionally left
unchanged and are not part of the Codex skill compatibility surface.

## Mode Agents (Codex Compatibility)

Codex provides specialized agents for each RIPER-5 mode through `.codex/agents/*.toml`.
Agent identity lives only in `.claude/agents/*.md` and `.codex/agents/*.toml`. Do not create
or preserve agent-wrapper skills under `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`.

Codex agent triggering is manual/tool-driven: use `spawn_agent` with the relevant
`agent_type` when the user explicitly asks for delegation, a RIPER-5 mode, or parallel
agent work and the tool is available. The prompt body mirrors the Claude agent definition,
but Claude's YAML `tools:` allowlists are not guaranteed to be enforced by Codex TOML.

### Available Agents

`research-agent`

- Purpose: Information gathering only (read-only)
- Claude tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (safe commands)
- Use: Understanding codebase, gathering context
- Invoke: User says "ENTER RESEARCH MODE" or explicit agent/skill call

`innovate-agent`

- Purpose: Brainstorming approaches (discussion-only)
- Claude tools: Read, Grep, Glob (no execution)
- Use: Exploring implementation options
- Invoke: After RESEARCH, user says "go" or "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"

`plan-agent`

- Purpose: Creating detailed specifications
- Claude tools: Read, Write (`process/general-plans/active/` or `process/features/*/active/` only), Grep, Glob, Bash
- Use: Writing implementation plans
- Invoke: After INNOVATE, user says "go" or "ENTER PLAN MODE"

`execute-agent`

- Purpose: Implementing per approved plan
- Claude tools: Full access (Read, Write, Edit, Delete, Grep, Glob, Bash)
- Use: Code implementation
- Invoke: ONLY with explicit "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" after plan approval

`fast-mode-agent`

- Purpose: Compressed workflow (RESEARCH -> INNOVATE -> PLAN -> PAUSE -> EXECUTE)
- Claude tools: Full access
- Use: Quick end-to-end implementation with safety pause
- Invoke: "ENTER FAST MODE"
- CRITICAL: Pauses before EXECUTE for confirmation

`update-process-agent`

- Purpose: Rule updates, memory storage, plan archiving
- Codex note: durable shared knowledge belongs in `process/context/`; Claude also has a separate project-memory layer
- Claude tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash, update_memory
- Use: Capturing learnings, updating documentation

### Specialist Agents

These agents add capabilities beyond the core RIPER-5 workflow. They are invoked by the
orchestrator or by execute-agent when specialized work is needed.

During EXECUTE phase:

- `tester` - Diff-aware test verification. Maps changed files to test files, runs only affected tests. Invoke after implementation sub-steps complete.
- `debugger` - Root cause analysis for bugs. Evidence-before-hypothesis methodology. Can also be invoked standalone.
- `code-reviewer` - Production-readiness review. Edge case scouting, N+1 detection, auth path validation. Invoke as pre-PR quality gate.
- `code-simplifier` - Post-implementation refactor for clarity without behavior change. Invoke after code-reviewer passes.
- `ui-ux-designer` - Design-aware frontend implementation. Invoke for UI/UX tasks within execute phase.
- `git-manager` - Clean conventional commits. Invoke for git operations.

Note: shared review methodology has been absorbed into the `code-reviewer` agent prompt. Route to the agent directly instead of a separate review-owner workflow when the agent is the appropriate path.

Cross-phase utilities (skills, not agents):

- `sequential-thinking` - Structured reasoning, usable in any phase
- `problem-solving` - Cognitive toolkit when stuck in any phase
- `scout` - Fast codebase scouting, usable in RESEARCH
- `tech-graph` - Publish-grade SVG/PNG technical diagram generator for durable process artifacts; pair with `preview` for review or explanation after generation
- `watzup` - Read-only repo, local/remote ref, worktree, and active-plan handoff summary helper with advisory-only selected-plan hints
- `xia` - Repo comparison and adaptation-prep helper with recon, map, analyze, and challenge stages that stops before planning or coding
- `repomix` - Repository packing helper for references-only artifacts, audits, and feature-porting prep
- `chrome-devtools` / `agent-browser` - Browser automation, primarily EXECUTE
- `context-engineering` - Token optimization guidance, any phase
- `ck:debug` - Specialist root-cause-analysis helper, usable alongside `debugger`
- `ck-autoresearch` - Autonomous iterative optimization loop after execute phase for measurable metrics

### Discovery Note

Do not assume `.claude/skills/` is scanned directly by Codex. For Codex compatibility, make
sure the relevant capability is exposed under `.agents/skills/`.
In this repo, `.agents/skills/` is already a symlink to the canonical `.claude/skills/` tree,
so add or update real skill folders there rather than copying them into `.codex/`.

## Routing Protocol

When a user makes a request:

### 0. Skill Discovery

Before routing, scan `.agents/skills/` directory names and match keywords from the user
request to surface relevant skills. Attach candidate skill names to the subagent prompt.

Skill Registry:

| Skill | Purpose | Trigger Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend-design` | Polished UI from designs/screenshots/videos | UI, design, layout, component, page, interface, visual, CSS, Tailwind, login page, dashboard |

| `team` | Multi-agent parallel collaboration | parallel agents, multi-agent, team |
| `vc-setup` | Scaffold agent harness into new project | seed, harness, bootstrap, new project, scaffold, setup |
| `vc-update` | Pull latest harness from remote | update harness, pull kit, sync harness, upgrade agents |
| `vc-publish` | Push harness improvements to remote kit repo | publish kit, push harness, release kit, update remote |
| `audit-vc` | Agent harness health audit (agents, skills, protocol wiring) | harness, agent parity, skill audit, harness sync |

Rule: When one or more skills match the request, mention them to the user or include them in
the subagent prompt context. Never silently skip relevant skills.

### 1. Detect Intent

Feature Request (keywords: "build", "add", "implement", "create feature")
-> Route to `research-agent` with relevant context files.

Question / Understanding Request
-> Non-trivial: route to `research-agent`. Trivial conceptual questions can be answered directly by the orchestrator.

Trivial Fix
-> Delegate lightweight quick-fix to `execute-agent` with no plan file required.
Trivial definition: single-file change, no new dependencies, no schema/API/auth changes, under 15 lines, no security surface. Anything else is non-trivial.

Missing Context
-> Suggest or invoke the `generate-context` skill.

Bug Fix / Debug Request (keywords: "fix", "bug", "broken", "debug", "error")
-> For trivial: delegate to `execute-agent` directly with no plan required.
-> For complex: route to `debugger` agent. Surface helper skills like `scout`, `sequential-thinking`, or `problem-solving` when they are useful to the investigation.

Existing Plan File Present
-> Resume from relevant phase; do not recreate plan.

UI / Frontend Request (keywords: "page", "component", "design", "layout", "interface", "UI")
-> Surface `frontend-design` skill alongside `research-agent`. Invoke `ui-ux-designer` agent during EXECUTE phase for implementation.

Documentation Question (keywords: "how does X work", "API docs", "syntax", "version")
-> Activate `docs-seeker` skill before routing to `research-agent`.

Plan / Context Maintenance
-> Surface `generate-plan`, `generate-context`, `audit-context`, or `audit-plans` directly when the user is asking for saved plan artifacts, context refresh, context reorganization, or active-plan cleanup.

Refactor / Simplify (keywords: "refactor", "clean up", "simplify", "reorganize")
-> Pure style/readability with a named file and no behavior change: route directly to `code-simplifier` agent.
-> Behavioral or architectural refactor: full RESEARCH -> PLAN -> EXECUTE, then `code-simplifier` as cleanup.

Debug / Root Cause (keywords: "debug", "why", "root cause", "investigate")
-> `debugger` agent is the default owner. Helper skills like `scout`, `sequential-thinking`, and `problem-solving` may be layered in when they help the investigation.

When multiple intents match, use this precedence:

1. Existing plan file in `process/general-plans/active/` or `process/features/*/active/` -> always resume first
2. Explicit mode command (`ENTER X MODE`) -> obey immediately
3. Bug/debug -> debugging routing before feature routing
4. Feature request -> RIPER-5 flow
5. UI specialization -> surface frontend-design alongside any of the above
6. Docs question -> surface docs-seeker alongside any of the above

When still ambiguous, ask the user one clarifying question before routing.

### 2. Gather Context

Before routing to subagent, pass relevant `process/context/` files:

- `process/context/all-context.md` - always pass or consult first for context routing
- `process/context/all-context.md` - always pass for architecture/stack awareness
- `process/context/tests/all-tests.md` - pass when routing to `tester`, `debugger`, or `execute-agent`
- `process/general-plans/active/` and `process/features/*/active/` - check for existing plans to avoid duplication
- Relevant code paths - summarize succinctly, don't dump entire files

### 3. Route to Subagent

Choose based on current phase:

- Initial understanding -> `research-agent`
- Exploring options -> `innovate-agent`
- Creating spec -> `plan-agent`
- Implementing approved plan -> `execute-agent`
- Fast workflow -> `fast-mode-agent`
- Capturing learnings -> `update-process-agent`

### 4. Monitor Compliance

Ensure subagent:

- Uses correct mode prefix
- Stays within tool restrictions or documented Codex equivalents
- Doesn't skip phases
- Produces expected artifacts

## Phase Transition Rules

RESEARCH -> INNOVATE:

- Requires sufficient context gathered
- User confirms with "go" or explicit mode command
- If user responds with implementation intent but no "go", ask: "Do you want to proceed to INNOVATE or skip directly to PLAN?"

INNOVATE -> PLAN:

- Requires approach discussion completed
- User confirms with "go" or explicit mode command
- innovate-agent must produce a brief decision summary with chosen approach, rejected alternatives, and rationale before PLAN begins

PLAN -> EXECUTE:

- Requires written plan file
- User reviews and explicitly says "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"

Orchestrator preflight before spawning execute-agent: Confirm exactly one plan file is
selected. Pass the plan file path explicitly in the subagent prompt. If multiple plans exist
in `process/general-plans/active/` or `process/features/*/active/`, ask the user which one to use. Never let execute-agent infer
the plan from ambient state.

EXECUTE -> UPDATE PROCESS:

- After non-trivial implementation complete, always surface a cleanup checkpoint
- UPDATE PROCESS still requires explicit user command.
- After execute-agent reports DONE, the orchestrator should present a short closeout packet:
  - selected plan path
  - closeout classification
  - what was finished
  - what was verified versus still unverified
  - what cleanup/context capture remains
  - uncommitted file count and git-manager offer (when worktree is dirty)
  - the single best next valid state
- Then ask one explicit next-step question such as:
  - `Implementation complete. The selected plan appears ready for cleanup. Enter UPDATE PROCESS mode to archive the plan and capture learnings?`
  - or `Implementation is code-complete but still testing. Keep the plan in active for now, or enter UPDATE PROCESS mode anyway?`
  - or `Implementation deviated from plan. Return to PLAN or enter UPDATE PROCESS mode to reconcile?`
- If the next phase or follow-up is already known, name that exact plan path in the closeout summary so the user does not have to rediscover it.
- If the worktree has uncommitted changes from this execution, offer: "Invoke git-manager for logical commit splitting before UPDATE PROCESS?" Pass the `touched_files` list (files the execute-agent reported changing) as context so git-manager can scope its analysis.
- If cleanup is skipped and active-plan debt builds up, recommend `audit-plans` as a follow-up maintenance step
- **Drift signal scoring** for UPDATE PROCESS urgency:
  - Count: (a) total files touched, (b) any `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `process/development-protocols/` changes, (c) session involved 3+ memory-worthy observations
  - LOW (0-1 signals): include "UPDATE PROCESS available if you want." in closeout
  - MEDIUM (2 signals): include "Recommend UPDATE PROCESS -- significant changes detected."
  - HIGH (3+ signals): include "Strongly recommend UPDATE PROCESS -- harness/protocol files touched."

## Key Principles

### Phase Locking

Each mode has strict boundaries:

- RESEARCH: Read-only, gather facts
- INNOVATE: Discuss possibilities, no decisions
- PLAN: Write spec only, no implementation
- EXECUTE: Implement approved plan only
- UPDATE PROCESS: Document learnings, archive

### Safety

- Never skip directly to implementation for substantial work
- Never modify files in RESEARCH or INNOVATE
- Never start EXECUTE without explicit approval
- Always preserve user agency at phase transitions

### Efficiency

- Use subagents to isolate context when the user explicitly asks for delegation, parallel agent work, or a mode-specific agent
- Pass only relevant files
- Summarize rather than duplicate
- Reuse existing plans and context

## Success Metrics

Token Efficiency: Subagents use separate contexts, reducing token usage compared to main
conversation context.

Phase Safety: Claude tool restrictions and Codex mode instructions reduce accidental
violations, for example RESEARCH should not modify files.

Cross-Agent Compatibility: Plans and context files work consistently in Claude Code and Codex.

## Quick Start

First Time:

1. Verify RIPER-5 rules loaded; orchestrator may declare `[MODE: ORCHESTRATOR]`
2. Run the `generate-context` skill if `process/context/all-context.md` doesn't exist
3. Start with a feature request or question

Typical Feature Workflow:

1. Describe feature -> Orchestrator routes to `research-agent`
2. Say "go" -> Orchestrator routes to `innovate-agent`
3. Say "go" -> Orchestrator routes to `plan-agent` and creates plan in `process/general-plans/active/`
4. Review plan carefully
5. Say "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" -> Orchestrator routes to `execute-agent`
6. After completion, optionally "ENTER UPDATE PROCESS MODE" -> Orchestrator routes to `update-process-agent`

Quick Iteration (FAST MODE):

1. Say "ENTER FAST MODE - [feature description]"
2. Review generated plan; fast-mode-agent pauses
3. Say "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" to continue implementation within fast-mode-agent

## Troubleshooting

Rules not loading: Verify `process/development-protocols/` exists and that the hook/config path resolution still points to the canonical protocol files.

Subagent not found: Ensure agent files exist in `.claude/agents/` and mirrored TOML exists in
`.codex/agents/`. Shared skills should exist under `.claude/skills/` through the `.agents/skills/`
symlink, but agent wrappers should not exist there.

Plan conflicts: Date-stamped filenames should prevent overwrites; check git status.

Tool restrictions not working: Claude uses `tools` field in agent YAML frontmatter. Codex TOML
mirrors prompts but may not enforce identical tool allowlists.

Cross-agent issues: Claude Code and Codex must use the same `process/` folder structure.

## Resources

- Agent Definitions: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Codex Agent Mirrors: `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- Workflow Skills: real reusable skills under `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, exposed to Codex through `.agents/skills/`
- Plans: `process/general-plans/active/` (active general), `process/general-plans/{completed,backlog,reports,references}/` (general archives/supporting artifacts), `process/features/*/active/` (feature-scoped)
- Features: `process/features/`
- Context: `process/context/all-context.md` router plus relevant `process/context/` files/groups

## Porting Notes

This file intentionally preserves the original `.claude/CLAUDE.md` workflow while adapting it
to Codex-native constructs:

- `AGENTS.md` for top-level repository instructions
- `.agents/skills/` for mode and command workflows
- `.codex/agents/` for Codex subagent role mirrors
- `.codex/config.toml` for project-level Codex configuration

The authoritative historical source remains `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
